Prior to Boot Camp, for the past 15 years, I was the Assistant Treasurer for Hamilton County.  Prior to that I was a Manager of Clinical Data Operations for a Clinical Research Organization.

Why did I decided to go to Boot Camp?  I was at a point where I was certain I no longer had a passion for or was inspired by the work I was doing.  After careful thought and consideration of what "sparked" my interest, I realized it was during the transition to a new relational database that I was most engaged.  Upon the suggestion of our Director of Information Technology I began to look into MAX Training.  From my initial review of the information on the website through each subsequent in person meeting with the MAX staff, Instructors and CEO, I decided that I would resign my position and enroll in the .NET boot camp.

I selected MAX because of their history of success working with and building relationships with local companies to understand their needs and to ensure that MAX graduates were properly prepared to begin a new career.

I had the opportunity to speak with individuals that were soon to complete thier bootcamp.  Their response was consistent with what MAX stated; that this is a rigorous program which will require between a 50 to 70 hour a week committment.  I expect it will take at least that for me to be successful.
